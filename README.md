# MichiganHackersiOSApp
The official Michigan Hackers iOS app.

Currently, the app supports/plans to support the following features:
* Calendar (when is Michigan Hackers Meeting?)
* Notifications (so you don't have to keep track of when everything is happening!)
* Resources (so you don't have to Google Search everything about computer science)

Feel free to contribute as well, or talk to the iOS Core Team about ideas.
